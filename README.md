three.js - triangulation
========

#### Triangulation comparison ####

The aim of the project is to create compare the results of different triangulation/tesselation algorithms/libraries in three.js

— [Original](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/extras/ShapeUtils.js) (original algorithm from THREE.ShapeUtils)
— [Earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut) (earcut triangulation library)
— [poly2tri](https://github.com/r3mi/poly2tri.js) (poly2tri triangulation library)
— [libtess](https://github.com/brendankenny/libtess.js/) (libtess tesselation library)


### Usage ###

For now there are two viewers.

- One single screen viewer where the triangulation result of a certain shape with a selected algorithm can be viewed.
- And multiple screen viewer where the triangulation result of a certain shape can be seen for all algorithms at the same time.
